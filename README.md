# Dog-Cat-Classification
Deep learning (Convolutional Neural Network) 

Artificial intelligence is one trending topic of this decade. Application of artificial intelligence is growing exponentially in every Engineering field known to human kind. Deep learning is a technique used in Artificial Intelligence for applications like speech recognition, face recognition, Object detection etc. Image classification is a problem to classify between two or more objects or people. In this project we are going to identify weather the given picture is of a dog or a cat. Same project can also be used to identify between human face which are used nowadays in mobile, surveillance system.
